# Sales Data Analysis Project:
This project involves analyzing sales data from a sample dataset to extract actionable insights. Key features include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
- Visualizing trends such as sales over time, product line performance, and top-performing regions.
- Analyzing order size distribution and its impact on revenue.
